This is descriptive of the Repository for the Project, and the aim is understanding the concept of team work when handling a project in a Real life world scenarioto demisify the concept of printf.
This project tasks are completely linked to the corresponding files.

Task 0
* Write a function that produces output according to format.
  converts input into a character: -c
  converts input into a string: -s
  
Task 1
* Handle the following conversion specifiers.
  converts input into a base 10 integer: -d
  converts input into an integer: _i
  
Task 2
* Create a man page for your function.
  
Task 3
* Handle the following conversion specifiers.
  The unsigned int argument is converted to binary: -b
  
Task 4
* Handle the following conversion specifiers
  converts the input into an unsigned integer: -u
  converts the input into an octal number: -o
  converts the input into a hexadecimal number: -x
  converts the input into a hexadecimal number with capital letters: -x
  
Task 5
* Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

Task 6
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier.
  prints the string: -s
  Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

Task 7
* Handle the following conversion specifier
  int input is converted to a pointer address: -p
  
Task 8
* Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers
  adds a \+ in front of signed positive numbers and a \- in front of signed negative numbers: - \+
  same as \+, but adds a space (is overwritten by \+): -space
  adds a 0 in front of octal conversions that don't begin with one, and a 0x or 0X for x or X conversions: - \#
  
Task 9
* Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers.
  converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in short signed or unsigned ints: -l
  converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in long signed or unsigned ints: -h
  
Task 10
* Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 11
* Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 12
* Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 13
* Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 14
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier
  prints the reversed string: - r
  
Task 15
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier
  prints the rot13'ed string: -R
  
Task 16
* All the above options work well together.
